Class project P3.
BACKGROUND
Amazonian Delivery Services is piloting a drone delivery service in a specified region of the country. 
To avoid conflicts with other air traffic the FAA has restricted drone flights to defined pathways between designated way-points. 
The paths between way-points are given valuesâ€”lower values are preferred paths. Moreover fees are assessed on the total path score,
so it is in Amazonian interest to route drones using the lowest cost path from the warehouse to its destination.

ASSIGNMENT
Create a class, DroneRouter, that will determine the best (i.e. minimum cost) path between the distribution center and 
a specified waypoint. The DroneRouter class will implement the Router interface (provided).
